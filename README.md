# QGIS-Area-with-Population-Count-and-respective-Distance-To-Nearest-Hub-
This repository presents the Concept of Demand vs. Service Value


The aim of this repository is to implement the following idea:

What we have: 

**layer <-> geometry**
population density <-> points
area map <-> raster
Hub (e.g. Health Centers) distribution <-> points

What we calulate:
- amount of point in an area and its distance to the nearest hub. 

Why we do it: 
- The 
Divide a map into smaller areas (e.g. hexagons), count the points in this dedicated area and calculate the distance from this area to the nearest hub.
